**I would like to thank the communities behind the open software libraries, Christoph Gohlke for the wheel files to make the PyMOL installation comfortable (and without the hassle of compling PyMOL from source), Martin Urban for end-user testing and especially Warren L. DeLano for their amazing work.**

## About PyMOL
[PyMOL™](https://pymol.org/) is a powerful visualization software for rendering and animating 3D molecular structures. PyMOL is a trademark of Schrödinger, LLC.

Please note that the files provided here are **unofficial**. They are informal, unrecognized, and unsupported, offered for testing and evaluation purposes only. No warranty or liability is provided, and the software is made available "as-is."

## Contents of this repository
"Insert some more information here"

## From source
The following information is about building a platform dependent package/setup from source.

### Prerequisites for Windows
- Inno Setup compiler 6
  - Install location must be: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe`

### Prerequisites for Linux
- Ruby (**only** if fpm is used for packaging)
  - apt (Debian or Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install ruby-full`
  - yum (CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL): `sudo yum install ruby`

### Step-by-step guide
1. Create a new Python virtual environment
2. Install build dependencies using the requirements.txt of your platform
3. Build the app package:

#### Windows
If you are on Windows run:
```shell
.\pymake.bat build_app
```
```shell
.\pymake.bat build_inno_setup architecture=x64
```

#### macOS
If you are on macOS:
```shell
chmod +x ./pymake.sh && ./pymake.sh build_app
```
To build the DMG use a tool like [create-dmg](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg) or fork the repository 
and run the GitHub action build_app.yaml.

#### Linux
If you are on Linux:
```shell
chmod +x ./pymake.sh && ./pymake.sh build_app
```
To build the tar.gz run:
```shell
mkdir -p packaged/build/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>
cp -r ./dist/exe.linux*/* packaged/build/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>/
mkdir -p packaged/bin
tar czvf packaged/bin/PyMOL-Open-Source_v<version-number>.tar.gz packaged/build/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>
```
If you want to build a .deb or .rpm package, you could use the Ruby gem called fpm:
```shell
sudo gem install fpm
mkdir -p package-root/opt/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>
cp -r ./dist/exe.linux*/* package-root/opt/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>/
mkdir -p package-root/usr/bin
ln -s /opt/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>/Open-Source-PyMOL package-root/usr/bin/Open-Source-PyMOL
mkdir -p package-root/usr/share/applications
cp os_specific/linux/open-source-pymol.desktop package-root/usr/share/applications
sed -i "s|/opt/open-source-pymol|/opt/PyMOL-Open-Source-<version-number>|g" package-root/usr/share/applications/open-source-pymol.desktop

fpm -s dir -t deb \
-n PyMOL-Open-Source \
-v <version-number> \
-a amd64 \
-C package-root \
--description "PyMOL installation for debian-based distros" \
--license "BSD-3-Clause" \
```

## Acknowledgements
**Schrödinger** for being the driving force behind the continued development of PyMOL after Warren's passing, ensuring that the open-source version remained alive and well.

**NOTE**: the following list has not been updated since Fall 2003 and was originally created by Warren himself.

Since then, the PyMOL effort has grown to such an extent that it is no longer
practical to recognize everyone individually.  Fortunately, a public
record of participation exists and can be appreciated on the internet,
and especially via the PyMOL mailing list archives.  Suffice it to say
that the PyMOL user community now numbers well into the thousands and
includes scientists, students, and educators worldwide, spread
throughout academia and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries.  Though DeLano Scientific LLC specifically supports and
maintains the PyMOL code base, the project can only continue to
succeed through the sponsorship and participation of the broader
community.

**Founder and Principal Author**:

      Warren L. DeLano 

Major Authors (5000+ lines of code):

      Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve (SGLite Module)

Minor Authors (500+ lines of code):

      Scott Dixon (Metaphorics CEX support)
      Filipe Maia (Slice Objects)

Other Contributors: These are the people who have gone out of
their way to help the project with their ideas, actions,
advice, hardware donations, testing, information, sponsorship,
peer support, or code snippets.

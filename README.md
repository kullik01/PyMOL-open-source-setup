## Description
PyMOL-open-source-setup is an open project that 
aims 

## Contents of this repository
### Sources
There are five different Python packages that contain functionality for specific aspects of the architecture. 

- _pyssa_ 
  - The package contains Python modules, Qt .ui files and cascading stylesheets.


### Assets
The <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/PyMOL-open-source-setup/tree/main/assets">"assets"</a> folder consists of the subfolders <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/PyMOL-open-source-setup/tree/main/assets/convert_to_ico">"convert_to_ico"</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/PyMOL-open-source-setup/tree/main/assets/raw">"raw"</a>. 
The <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/PyMOL-open-source-setup/tree/main/assets/convert_to_ico">"convert_to_ico"</a> folder contains a batch script,
which converts the logo.png image of various resolutions (from 16x16 to 256x256) into a multi-resolution .ico file.
Moreover, the folder includes individual PNG files for each resolution, a generated logo.ico file, and the original logo.png.
The <a href="https://github.com/kullik01/PyMOL-open-source-setup/tree/main/assets/raw">"raw"</a> subdirectory includes the logo in its original vector format as an SVG file.

## Installation
PyMOL-open-source-setup is tested and available for Windows 10 and 11.
### Windows

**I would like to thank the communities behind the open software libraries, Christoph Gohlke for the wheel files to make the PyMOL installation comfortable (and without the hassle of compling PyMOL from source), Martin Urban for end-user testing and especially Warren L. DeLano for their amazing work.**
